# :rocket: devops-accelerator-project

Welcome to the **DevOps Accelerator Project (DOAP)**. This repository helps you get your base infrastructure up and running quickly using well-known Terraform modules, GitOps blueprints, and tried-and-tested configurations for cloud automation, observability, alerting, and CI/CD.

## 📋 Project Overview

When starting a new project or startup, getting your cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps automation in place can be overwhelming, especially with a small team. This project aims to simplify that process by providing scaffolding for:

- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code** using **Terraform**
- 🌐 **GitOps** integration with **ArgoCD**
- 🔍 **Observability** using popular tools
- 🧰 **CI/CD Pipelines** for seamless automation
- 📊 **Monitoring & Alerting** configuration
- 🧪 **Tested Configurations** from real-world experiences

## 🔥 Why DevOps Accelerator Project (DOAP)?

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, startups and projects are expected to scale quickly and efficiently. However, setting up the infrastructure needed to support such growth can be daunting, especially when:

- You have a small team or are a solo DevOps engineer.
- The demands of managing cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, and observability often pull you in multiple directions.
- Time and resource constraints limit your ability to implement robust, scalable solutions from scratch.

## 🚀 Motivation

The **DevOps Accelerator Project (DOAP)** was born from the need to **simplify and streamline** the initial setup process for DevOps practices, allowing you to focus on building your product. We’ve encountered the same challenges—setting up everything manually takes time, effort, and can slow down progress. This project is designed to:

- **Accelerate** the process of getting your infrastructure up and running with minimal effort.
- **Standardize** the use of well-known and trusted Terraform modules and GitOps blueprints to ensure reliability and best practices.
- **Automate** the most time-consuming tasks in DevOps, like provisioning resources, monitoring, alerting, and configuring CI/CD pipelines, so you can focus on delivering features.
- **Empower** teams of any size to manage cloud infrastructure effortlessly by offering pre-built, reusable templates and configurations.

By leveraging this project, you'll gain a head start on all the essential infrastructure components needed to support modern applications, from deployment pipelines to cloud resources. We believe that automation should free you to innovate, not bog you down with repetitive configuration tasks.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruanbekker/devops-accelerator-project.git doap
cd doap
```

### 2. Provision Infrastructure

Navigate to the `terraform/environments/` folder for your environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) and apply the Terraform code:

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 3. Set Up GitOps

- Review the **ArgoCD** apps in `argocd/apps/` and make adjustments for your environment.
- Deploy the applications via ArgoCD:

```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd/apps/
```

### 4. Configure CI/CD Pipelines

Make sure your workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory, and customize them to fit your environment.
